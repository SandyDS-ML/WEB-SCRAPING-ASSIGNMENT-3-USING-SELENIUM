Features a sturdy top with smooth curves, promoting comfort during playing. This solid wood produces a smooth and rich sound ideal for rock, folk, country, and every genre in between.Loosening a truss rod (turning counter-clockwise) adds relief to (decreases tension on) the neck which results in increased (higher) string action height. This reduces relief, lowering the string action (height of the strings over the frets). Turn the nut clockwise to tighten the rod.Included components: Acoustic Guitar with Strap, Bag, Strings, Truss Rod Wrench/Allen Key and 2 Plectrums</td>\n",

Features a sturdy top with smooth curves, promoting comfort during playing. This solid wood produces a smooth and rich sound ideal for rock, folk, country, and every genre in between.Loosening a truss rod (turning counter-clockwise) adds relief to (decreases tension on) the neck which results in increased (higher) string action height. This reduces relief, lowering the string action (height of the strings over the frets). Turn the nut clockwise to tighten the rod.Included components: Acoustic Guitar with Strap, Bag, Strings, Truss Rod Wrench/Allen Key and 2 Plectrums   \n",
